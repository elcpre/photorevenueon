We process your personal data for various purposes and based on different legal grounds:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Processing and fulfillment of orders:</strong> We use your data to process your order, deliver products and services, process payments, and communicate with you about your order.

  <h2>How We Secure Your Information</h2>

We understand the importance of data security and have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of information.

  <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
<p>
Our operations are located primarily in Spain, and our online infrastructure is configured to store and process data in this country. However, in order to process your data as described in this privacy policy, it may be necessary for us to transfer your data internationally.
</p>
<p>
For instance, some of our third-party service providers may be located outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). Whenever we transfer your data outside of the EEA, we ensure that the recipient provides an adequate level of protection for your data, and that appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your privacy rights and to ensure you can exercise your legal rights. This can include transferring the data to a country that the European Commission recognizes as providing an adequate level of protection, or using contractual clauses that have been approved by the European Commission.

  <div class="legal-text">
  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and processed, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting or reporting requirements.
</p>

<p>
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
</p>

<p>
In some circumstances, we may anonymize your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
</p>

<p>
Upon expiry of the applicable retention period we will securely destroy your personal data in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
</p>

  </div>
  <div class="legal-text">
  <h2>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
We reserve the right to update or change our Privacy Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you either through the email address you have provided us, or by placing a prominent notice on our website.
